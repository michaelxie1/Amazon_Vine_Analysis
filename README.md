# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
**Purpose**

The purpose of this project was to be introduced to the concepts of big data and be able to extract and analyze large datasets. This was done so through Amazon Webs Services (AWS), where we created a Postgres database by setting up our own relational database. I selected a random dataset of Amazon reviews and began the ETL process to extract the information necessary.

The total number of paid vine reviews is 613, and the total number of unpaid vine reviews is 64968.

There were 222 paid 5-star vine reviews, and 30543 unpaid 5-star vine reviews.
In terms of percentages, the number of paid 5-star vine reviews was approximately 36%, while the unpaid reviews were about 47%.

Out of the vine reviews that were not 5 stars, about 64% were paid, while about 53% were unpaid.

**Summary**

The resulting information does not indicate a positivity bias, but it can be indicated that within the 5-star reviews, the percentage was higher in unpaid compared to paid. In contrast, the vine reviews that were not 5-stars was the opposite- the unpaid percentage was lower compared to paid. Within this dataset, it is also possible to see how reliable the votes were, as factoring in whether or not the reviews were actually helpful could also have a large impact on the dataset.
